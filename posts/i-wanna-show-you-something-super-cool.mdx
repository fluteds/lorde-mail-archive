i wanna show you something super cool - melodrama, live at electric lady. 
i’ve never done a stripped-back session before; they never made sense with the pure heroine stuff, which was obviously born totally electronic. 
a lot of melodrama came from real instruments, and it was super fun digging into that for these six sessions. 
everything from HOMEMADE DYNAMITE, done with a girl gang and a linn drum; SOBER, all culty and minor-chordy with a circle of organs and synths around me, and french horns !!! ; or WRITER IN THE DARK with jack sitting next to me at the exact piano where i first plinked out that hook. 
this studio means so much to me - this is legit the very room where we made most of the album, drank a million smoothies, watched the snow fall through the windows, and shared all my secrets. 
seemed important to go back to the exact spot and channel the heart flows again. 
i hope you love these videos like i loved making them.
