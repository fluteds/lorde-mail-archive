Oh hellllllllo there.
It’s Ella!
I’m in the South; I just drank something called a “blue razz slush” and I’m feeling particularly sugar/ice addled!!!

Thanks a bunch for sticking your email into this here mailing list, I’m very grateful. Promise I won’t send you a bunch of trash about what I’ve got going on. Instead, I’ll try be like that cool overseas friend you get a Facebook message from once every six months.
If you signed up here, you’re after the presale code. I’m so pleased you’re interested in seeing a show on the MELODRAMA WORLD TOUR & these shows we’ve been playing so far for Melodrama are electric and emotional and full on dance parties to boot.

The code is: **wasters** Go go go.

Be seeing you very soon…..
