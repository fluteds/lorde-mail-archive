Hi again!

As promised, two commemorative merch pieces to celebrate the end of Melo, available for [preorder](https://href.li/?https://lorde.store/) now til the end of the year. One super-cool crew neck sweater and one beautiful long-sleeved T-shirt, both with a little note from me on the back. These are just for the weird nerds who care about beginnings and ends, like me. One day your kid will be like “what’s this T-shirt?” and you can be like “Oh, just a commemorative Melodrama thing” and feel all cool. Because let’s be real, Melodrama’s going to age like the finest of wines. Ok I hate myself.

Love you. Happy holidays.
