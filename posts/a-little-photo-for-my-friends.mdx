Hello there, it’s me —

Been a while since we last spoke. I hope you’re having a great summer, and that you’ve been able to take some time to be outdoors. I recommend a walk to breathe in greenery and listen to the insects, an early morning rise looking out at the ocean, or if you’re in a city, a drink with ice in it, enjoyed in the warm summer dark. Wanted to share a happy photo of myself, taken on Martha’s Vineyard in a friend’s beautiful vege garden a couple of weeks ago. We decided that if I was a vegetable I would be a leek :-)

Miss you. Sending love

L xx
