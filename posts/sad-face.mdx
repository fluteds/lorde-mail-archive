Hello sweet ones,

So you may have heard by now about the postponement of the Australia and NZ Solar Power shows.
No words can tell you how gutted I am by this. The reality of a developing COVID management system in both countries just means there’s too much uncertainty for the promoters to feel confident we wouldn’t be at risk of last-minute show cancellations due to possible lockdowns. I’m well aware (and hopeful) restrictions could be stable and workable by February, but we don’t know that for sure, and the pressure was on to make a decision so our crew could find other work and our venues and promoters could properly re-book our shows. This is not me being a flake, this is not me being pregnant (you dweebs it was a EUPHEMISM I’M NOT PREGNANT HAHA), this is me and the whole team who planned this tour being no match for a really complex public health situation.
I am absolutely devastated to let you down. I feel physically ill typing this. I wanted so badly to be the light at the end of this lockdown hell tunnel for you guys. I think about gorgeous angels like Courtney in NZ, or Josiah and Maddie in Australia, people who have been there supporting me since the beginning, people who have tickets and accommodation plans already, and my stomach just drops. I hope you know how deeply I value your commitment to me as an artist, and the relationships we all have, and I’d NEVER take them for granted. Please know that if there’d been ANY way to avoid this, I would have.

Some slightly brighter news:
We’ve been able to add second shows in Wellington, Brisbane and Perth so that’s sick! That presale is available Wednesday using strangeairlines as your special code.
And some wider tour news: I’m very jazzed to announce that I’m taking the delicious Remi Wolf on the US tour. I absolutely adore Remi’s buzzy smart pop tunes and you should definitely listen to her a lot in preparation. I first was introduced to her via my bandmate Jimmy who played ‘Shawty’ at every party one summer, but her recent EP and new album Juno slap also.
And in Europe and the UK, the magnificent Marlon Williams will be joining us!!!!! Marlon is basically God’s gift to ears and also a really great hang and super funny. He’s a towering presence live, he’s gonna fuck you up and also make you fall in love… because have you seen him… We’re partial to singing together when we can so you might be treated to an impromptu song or two.
We still haven’t chosen the Aus and NZ supports, partly because of the developing situation. I am hard in the brainstorm zone… Email me if you think of anyone who would be rad, but I promise to bring you some amazing openers in ‘23.

Anyway. I hope you can understand the shitty situation. It’s ok if you’re mad at me, I’m mad at me too. Just know I did everything I could. The new dates are in full below.

I’ll see you there,

Ella xxxxxxxxx
