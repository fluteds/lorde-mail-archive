Thought I’d pop in and say hi.<br/>Man, 2021 is a real fucking head spinner. Remember January 1st? I woke up and took a kayak out to the pontoon (paddling very gently, head very delicate). I lay down in the sun and shut my eyes — yeah, yeah, I’m a caricature of myself at this point — thinking about the year that stretched ahead. It was gonna be hard work, a big change, but nothing I didn’t want, or couldn’t handle. Covid was starting to recede — it’d all be sweet.<br/>Fuckin sikeeeee!<br/>The pandemic has continued to make things difficult, lonely, or dangerous for absolutely everyone in varying degrees, but outside of that, 2021 has been tough in completely unexpected ways. Being away from home at a time where the country’s struggling to contain the virus, feeling isolated from friends and loved ones there. Looking out at the country I’m in and feeling estranged from so much of what I see, and knowing it feels as estranged from me. Questioning what I’m doing and why, all the time, on an unprecedented level. Dealing with rough patches in close relationships, and feeling sensitive and emotional and reactive as a result. And missing you! The decision to step back from social media has been something I’ve really questioned through this time. I was so sure skipping the negatives (compulsive time-wasting, IV drip of dread, satisfying but hollow validation loop) would outweigh missing out on the positives (feeling like part of a community, hearing your sweet words, hitting you back) . But I’ve really, really missed you. Normally I’d be doing festivals and shows already, pinging around the world and touching your faces, so that probably contributes to the loneliness a little bit. But man. I’m trying to think about how best to balance the digital diet, in a way that feels fun and connected for me and you, but not at the expense of our attention, time or happiness.<br/>Sorry if this is a heavy vibe! I’m surprised by it too, honestly. MUCH TO CONTEMPLATE, YEAR OF REALISING STUFF, ETC ETC.<br/><br/>If there’s one thing I know right now, it’s how drawn I am to the sensual, things that make me feel like I’m a person in a body on a planet, things that feel alive. If <strike>2016</strike> this year is the year of realising things, I want next year to be the year of friction. Physical, emotional, spiritual. I want to rub up against everything, and see how it feels.<br/><br/>I wanted to share some things that I’ve enjoyed in this vein these past couple months that have nothing to do with work, or Lorde. Just things Ella likes. (<a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=b30f0cd13a&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">Just Ella Things</a>? Jesus.)<br/></p><ol><li>Walking 100 blocks. Lately I’ve been enjoying doing this on weekends. It’s a cool way to get an interesting cross section of multiple neighbourhoods. I go east, up park or Madison, dipping into Central Park and back out, or up the west side, 10th becoming Amsterdam, with a compulsory drift through Zabar’s. Good times.</li><li>Eating a lotus paste egg yolk moon cake from Tai Pan bakery.</li><li>The movie WALL-E. I might honestly do another newsletter on this, because holy shit, this movie rules.</li><li>Watching American Utopia on Broadway. I don’t know why I DIDN’T anticipate how much this would blow out the cobwebs. I left hoarse and hopped up on adrenaline like a kid after a school disco. This show feels like David’s masterwork, although I’m sure to him it’s just the current stop on his long, enriching train ride. The physicality of this thing, just what you can do with a dozen bodies on a stage, is unbelievable. I said to him that every person in it feels like the star, something I remember someone saying about each character in Jonathan Demme movies. What a rare and generous gift to give, to them and to us. RUN DON’T WALK!</li><li>This baking newsletter <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=6cdbf6d77f&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">Kitchen Projects</a>, which goes into great detail about the science of baking, and provides some lovely gifs.</li><li>Finally reading BLOOD, BONES AND BUTTER by Gabrielle Hamilton. Totally delightful and gnarly and makes me want to eat at Prune! I loved the author’s New York Times piece about what running a restaurant is like in these times, also. Come back soon, Prune.</li><li>Going to see the Lisa Yuskavage show. I’ve loved this artist’s work for years, but this new show was her at her JUICIEST and MOST ALIVE. Google images won’t do it justice, but look for what you can. Danielle McKinney’s work gives me a similar feeling right now, as does Owen Connors’ current show (discussed thoughtfully <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=2881bc3a3b&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">here</a>).</li><li>Kind of a separate vibe, but every year Aotearoa New Zealand gets all crazy over Bird of the Year. It’s a legitimate topic of national conversation, emotions run high, etc. This year I’m rooting for the Kororā! You may have seen me mention the <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=98efd0369a&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">Protect Pūtiki</a> movement that’s taking place on Waiheke Island. The bay is home to the largest population of Kororā in Tīkapa Moana/the Hauraki Gulf, and they need all the attention they can get.

I’ve got long replies drafting to a bunch of you right now. I’m glad it’s not just me — seems like we’re all going tf through it this year. I can. not. wait. until we’re dancing and screaming it out together next year at the shows.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="900"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/9bc41c84171f86ddfeb49dab4b151c2b/d31d77c79412a80f-04/s540x810/679da8cb5d57bafff709a236edf360cb8eb62233.jpg" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="900"/></figure><p>Guys. Damon’s Halloween costume. I can’t. Obsessed. (SIDENOTE, IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT I COULD BE FOR HALLOWEEN, DROP IT IN THE INBOX. I’VE NEVER REALLY DONE HALLOWEEN BUT IT SEEMS FUN, BUT MY BRAIN ISN’T A GOOD GENERATOR OF COSTUMES, THE ONLY ONE I CAN EVER THINK OF IS ‘WITCH’????

Katie, give the people what they want and open an Etsy shop!!!<br/><br/>Received a really lovely note from Adrian about the album, drawing some lines between it and Leaves of Grass, describing them as “two mirrors facing each other.” Heaven to me.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1424" data-orig-width="800"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3e84b1da4b225af34bbbd1c9236ab73f/d31d77c79412a80f-4e/s540x810/cc04b60935502b077c27b181d87a09cd000ac2cb.jpg" data-orig-height="1424" data-orig-width="800"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f91fc90a0f6b1f7ea88b95093c852007/d31d77c79412a80f-89/s540x810/0c121c623fd51e5c89a03d5a4b273e5c0441c4da.jpg" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800"/></figure><p>And last but not least, Odette and Vicky’s poster walls, which honestly make me puke with joy every time I see them.<br/><br/>More soon.

Title: BRACE FOR IMPACT…
<p>(09/09/2021) (Solar Institute Bulletin No. 7) (From New York City)<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="750" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4dfacf57fafd34d9a874406272545fea/1789b00ceae0a522-6f/s540x810/044d341883f34ae4fb85b876cf7e74f0b316d880.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="750"/></figure><p>Imagine NORTH by Tom Scott and the California Dreamers is playing<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Well hello.<br/><br/>Been 2 weeks since I wrote you. SP came out, and I ate black sesame cake in a corner feeling new and overwhelmed. We flew to LA and I did a really fun stint on Corden and some other $$$ecret business, then disappeared for a break (read so many books, got some sun, poked through a few yard sales, ate some really good smoked trout) and now here I am. Putting out records is wiiild. Total rebirth for you as well as me, I’m realising! I wanna say thankyou again, for caring so deeply about what I write down when I’m alone. I know this is different to what’s come before, something new from me. You deserve nothing less. It’s my honest belief that if you felt like you totally understood what I’d made instantly, I may not have done my job very well. I liked this quote I read from Verde Visconti the other day about how she buys clothes: “Maybe it’s just the fear of being too trendy,” she says. “But whatever I buy just waits in the closet until the right moment comes, which generally happens to be years later.” Some things you wear out of the shop, some you tuck away for the right time. But however you engage with what I make, I’m grateful.<br/><br/>Now.<br/>I have some VERY EXCITING NEWS. News I’ve been waiting a really long time to share with you. It is my great pleasure to present <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=e4335a9f51&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">TE AO MĀRAMA</a>, a 5-song companion piece to SOLAR POWER, sung entirely in te reo Māori, the indigenous language of Aotearoa New Zealand.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1000" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e94ca864840e605e4b2fac5f24a854e0/1789b00ceae0a522-fc/s540x810/569a08f9febd885e44a2d49cab4ee0ff9549344e.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1000"/></figure><p>Many things revealed themselves slowly to me while I was making this album, but the main realisation by far was that much of my value system around caring for and listening to the natural world comes from traditional Māori principles. There’s a word for it in te reo: kaitiakitanga, meaning ‘guardianship or caregiving for the sky, sea and land’. I’m not Māori, but all New Zealanders grow up with elements of this worldview. Te ao Māori and tikanga Māori are a big part of why people who aren’t from here intuit our country to be kind of ‘magical’, I think. I know I’m someone who represents New Zealand globally in a way, and in making an album about where I’m from, it was important to me to be able to say: this makes us who we are down here. It’s also just a crazy beautiful language— I loved singing in it. Even if you don’t understand te reo, I think you’ll get a kick out of how elegant my words sound in it. Hana’s translations for Te Ara Tika / The Path and Hine-i-te-Awatea / Oceanic Feeling in particular take my g-d breath away.<br/><br/>I told the full story of the project to Leonie Hayden, editor at The Spinoff Ātea, which I highly recommend you <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=2c936b61e9&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">check out here</a>.<br/><br/>Huge thanks go to Hemi and Hana for their exquisite translations and general wisdom/mana/lols, to Madeline and her aunties Sandra and Marian for their expert guidance, to my favourite Kiwi musicians Bic Runga and Marlon Williams who grace these songs, to Huia Hamon for graciously allowing me to colourise one of her papa Rei’s iconic works for the cover, and of course to Dame Hinewehi Mohi and the greatest of all time, Sir Tīmoti Kāretu for overseeing this.

I hope you understand.

Title: 🌳🏠🏠🏠🏠🚶🏻‍♀️🌳🌞
<p>EXCLUSIVE EMAIL TO NEW ZEALAND FANS</p><p>(08/19/2021) (Solar Institute Bulletin No. 5.5) (From New York City)</p><p>(Probably written on Aug 17th 2021, by date written on it)</p><figure data-orig-width="800" data-orig-height="1067" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/eca847f9bfffbea18ac5546ec91b1989/edcb214f6a38ffd1-cf/s540x810/c62eb6cb1175555f2f2f863baecbdc3ca8aae0f7.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="800" data-orig-height="1067"/></figure><p>Hey you,<br/>I’m sending this bulletin to Kiwis only — if you’re reading this, I guess you’re in lockdown right now.<br/>What a fucking shitter. This thing just doesn’t end.<br/>I hope you’re safe, and with people who don’t drive you up the wall. I hope you’re having some spirited household chats about what’s for lunch/dinner. Someone better have done some baking.<br/>I’m writing this from New York. It’s humid and sweltering. I feel sensitive and fragile, like a little Christmas ornament. Releasing shit is always scary, I’m scared of being misunderstood, and I really want the album to be what you want or need. I’ve been zipping round all day doing press and rehearsals, and my mind goes back to you twenty times a day. Friends send updates, but it’s weird not being there right now.</p><p>I’ve been asked a lot by journalists to what extent the pandemic has shaped this album, and I’ve kinda shrugged it off— we’d written most of the songs and the direction was pretty firm by March of 2020— but the truth is, lockdowns were a big part of Solar Power. We were really picking up steam on it when the first one happened, and I had this bizarre 5 or 6 months of waiting around at home, wondering when I could get into a studio again. I didn’t work much at all in that time. I wasn’t really having ideas. What I did was walk, every day, for 2 or 3 hours. At first I read on the walks, because the streets were so empty I didn’t need to look up that often. I can see now that this was classic embarrassing lockdown behaviour, but it really was nice, walking and reading in the chilly sun. Photographic evidence attached.</p><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0232657be8991c740d25a8db5704b938/edcb214f6a38ffd1-fb/s540x810/5774a7513e8e624bf28964bcfedca048d7d164e2.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/66421587ff0d7e5171f2bf8a0469a4d0/edcb214f6a38ffd1-42/s540x810/1930af9af93e968aeec37484fc1268343967c49a.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640"/></figure><p>After that trick wore off, I switched to listening to music. I had a phone full of shitty demos I was itching to work on, but I couldn’t, so I’d just walk all around town with them on repeat. The weather was amazing in that first lockdown, I feel like the sun just gave and gave. Like everyone else, lockdown brought up a bunch of crazy mental health shit for me; at home I’d feel emo, trapped, bad about my body, but on these long aimless walks I could feel the sun on my face and the cold clear air pumping in and out of my lungs, my legs pushing me forward, and it felt like the hypothesis of this weird thing I’d made was being reinforced, that going outside was medicine, or powerful magic, or something. I’d come back down the road to my house feeling like I’d taken care of myself.</p><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4b1b0702c7bd8eebf3e24b666dbaec1a/edcb214f6a38ffd1-49/s540x810/bc4fbf473342cce9873c95b47bc0d7e2b14d84d4.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a6a897f404ee3cd563585ea784236da7/edcb214f6a38ffd1-94/s540x810/d2d01c55c2fb984afc43990bb35b1b2ccb6a140b.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640"/></figure><p>A very good girl!</p><p>I’d walk around the back streets of Herne Bay, up Richmond Road through to Westmere. Over the boardwalk there where I used to walk my dog. Or I’d go down to the Viaduct and look at the light on the water. Or along Ponsonby Road if I wanted to see people, taking New North and then Surrey back around. Or I’d go down Karangahape Road, and through to the Domain from there, or up Newton Road for a bit until the inevitable realisation that I was just …walking past the Golf Warehouse looking at nothing, and I should probably turn back. But it’s safe to say if you saw me walking in a lockdown, I was probably listening to some version of a song from Solar Power.</p><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/86e2de7d29773cae28e2246d28b45760/edcb214f6a38ffd1-0f/s540x810/9eef06ce7057647a239d9037c5a80c52ab7e66f1.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ab714110fda68882a9ee39b8cf0f4062/edcb214f6a38ffd1-94/s540x810/1302b14a0ab2f1537db9c218151aca299e18e7a4.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0ecdbf38cbda59fd9c0d25aaa370cd07/edcb214f6a38ffd1-89/s540x810/d15576a677e02ea2291e2e5ad848dd6b4a32ecf3.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d37cb4d7edaf8a95b88f2bf3c8e45440/edcb214f6a38ffd1-6a/s540x810/8c534ba039512c4ff05dc9cffca1b215e5cbfcef.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="480" data-orig-height="640"/></figure><p>I have no answer as to why I took this many walking selfies.</p><p>Anyway, it sucks that you’re here again, but I hope you take Solar Power for a walk today, the same way I did over and over between March and May, moving at pace through the cold air (and hopefully a bit of sun), your steps keeping time.

Title: *great British bakeoff voice* It’s album week!
<p>(08/17/2021) (Solar Institute Bulletin No. 5) (From New York City)</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="470" data-orig-width="366"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0eab688bc2c82b13ca01daca930b1611/bb4eb10aee19555c-ff/s540x810/09b7e036504fc6a793cff3a6e0e802871a7ca84c.jpg" data-orig-height="470" data-orig-width="366"/></figure><p>Tapestry by Jean Lurçat<br/></p><p>Hello my sweets. I can’t quite believe it — the 20th is almost upon us. Three days from now, Solar Power will be yours. I’m not gonna get mushy, I’ll be saving that for the inevitable MUSHY ALBUM DAY BULLETIN, but I will say that at the moment I’m feeling the classic pre-album cocktail of fragile and psyched and shy at all times. This album took thousands of hours and a zillion units of personal growth to make and it’s starting to hit me.<br/><br/>Moving on&hellip;<br/><br/>It is my cosmic pleasure to share <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=477c28a71b&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">MOOD RING</a> with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="532" data-orig-width="1276"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/dea99c7823563dab1c307632fb026093/bb4eb10aee19555c-1f/s540x810/9a2a28a6ca3f0ebea2d02ae2f3a89784946eb0a5.jpg" data-orig-height="532" data-orig-width="1276"/></figure><p>I realised I had to write this song late last year — I kept waking up in the night and writing lines of lyric into my phone, which is how I usually know something’s gonna become a song.<br/>It was really interesting distilling some thoughts on wellness culture and the search for spiritual meaning in our modern world into a 3-minute pop song. The kind of challenge she likes best! Part of why this album was so FUN to make was that I got to explore these tropes of people seeking wellness, enlightenment or even utopia. The person who welcomes you to the island in Solar Power video is one, the dude in Dominoes is another, and now we can add this little lady to the mix. I didn’t name her, but you should go hard. I’ll say it once and then never again: this is satire. She is not me. :-)<br/><br/>It goes without saying I feel tons of empathy for this character. It was never my intention to fully flame her, although I don’t let her off the hook. We’re living through wild times, and it’s tough to begrudge anyone the methods they employ to feel sane, questionable though they may be. Something like a mood ring represented a sort of magical thinking, the same kind I dip into when I get my aura photographed, or try and bend my horoscope to my will — when I just need to believe something in a moment to feel good or clear. And deep down, I DO feel cozy and connected when someone asks me to ======set an intention for my practise===== at that start of a Pilates class, you know? Maybe you recognise elements of this character in yourself — I certainly sprinkled some things in that came straight from my life. Literally sprinkled… see chia seeds. Anyway I hope you love this song and video— I’m really proud of them both.<br/>PS This video was soooo relaxing to shoot, I can’t even tell you… I felt like I had had a spa day by the end. Eerie soothing case in point!!!<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1333" data-orig-width="1000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c2cb9cc5c7d4961d56b02e390d5283c/bb4eb10aee19555c-41/s540x810/c9b58e7539856a631d64e5f4177fae0bd7e6804b.jpg" data-orig-height="1333" data-orig-width="1000"/></figure><p>I’m deeply indebted to many sources of inspo here — this great piece  by Jia on <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=a7e84f4c64&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">optimisation</a>, this also great piece by my friend Tess on <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=956f0c3919&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">crystal provenance</a>, <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=47c00ba43f&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">the general realisation that many wellness practises adopted by white women have rough consequences for indigenous peoples</a>, every <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=1a7ca1665d&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">drink</a> that looks like <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=a50b146d43&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">this</a>, every little dropper bottle full of expensive black liquid that claims to “detoxify”, the Daily Mail, Erewhon, and of course the ultimate mood ring, my iP***e.<br/><br/>Other fun stuff that has happened that you’ve probably seen by now— this <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=e3bc4591b8&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">NYT diary of a song on SP</a>, along with these beautiful photos by Justin J Wee (who had a Team lyric tattoo and didn’t tell me, way to bury the lede Justin!!!)<br/><br/>I wanted to <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=77f1b98141&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">show you the music box</a> - obviously don’t look at this if you don’t want to see any of the art - but i figured it might help to have it explained.

Regular merch (including some hot hot hot new designs) will all available thru my site.)<br/><br/>Also I finally got my hands on a deluxe vinyl — holyyyyy shiiiiit, you are gonna freak.

Don’t know what I did to deserve such sweet, sensitive thoughtful people in my life. I’m replying to a few emails direct when I can. <br/><br/>Firstly, we need to give SCWWTS Kyra props for this INCREDIBLE crocheted SP bag! Like what Kyra!! I’m so impressed.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2497" data-orig-width="1873"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3f90664162bf3a0b50fafbe39b853da5/bb4eb10aee19555c-ab/s540x810/1e6be48b049a0bd2c799b08fc953586977191c02.jpg" data-orig-height="2497" data-orig-width="1873"/></figure><p>SCWWTS Matthew sent a lovely thoughtful email pointing out some of the linguistic connections between songs — lines like ‘half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor’ and ‘got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings’ — he asked “Are these bonds/connections/evolutions between your songs — now spanning three albums/eras and almost a decade — intentionally crafted, or is it more of a spiritual, subconscious thing?” Great question Matthew, they’re almost always intentional. I really love building in those little links and connections between past eras, and I try to be really careful and intentional with how I use language in songs. For example, there’s a moment on Solar Power I rework the ‘every perfect summer’ line from Liability — which invokes the original source while giving it new meaning for a new life stage. And those two lines you mentioned were actually set in the same bedroom. You clever thing.<br/><br/>SCWWTS Declan and SP share a birthday, which is delicious to me!! Happy Birthday, Declan! I’ll be thinking of you and sweet Hamish on the day.<br/><br/> SCsWWTS Felix and Nuria both asked what my favourite nail polish colour is. For a very long time I’ve gotten a shade called Oxblood on my toes. I’m also preferential to a deep, rich brown. I went to a nail salon the other day and realised, ‘Oh, I’ve totally fucked this for myself, I’m gonna be getting these weird looks from people when I’m getting pedicures for the rest of my life.’ It’s lit!<br/><br/>SCWWTS Chris wants to know if I have any interest in learning a language. It’s funny you ask that, Chris, because that’s since crept in as a bit of an upcoming goal. I’m keen to improve my te reo Māori, and I’d also love to learn Spanish one day! I still don’t have my license tho, so…. Maybe that first, Ella?<br/><br/>SCWWTS Sofía wrote, “The tall buildings and nice people of Mexico City are all I have ever know and leaving them behind, even if it could be just for a while, is frightening to me. Do you have any advice to jump head first into new adventures? I would love to hear your thoughts”. Sofía, I struggle with this myself. I find new places and people very stimulating and if I’m not in the right headspace, they can overwhelm me. My therapist gave me a really great way to frame this once, though — she said something along the lines of “This discomfort is a feeling you exchange for getting to live a bright, full life. In going out past your depth, metaphorically speaking, you are making a commitment to being as alive as you possibly can.” I hope that helps.<br/><br/>I guess that’s all? Here’s a photo of me typing this mailer.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1333" data-orig-width="1000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a95b142bce48ee3141699f9eb3dbb4a9/bb4eb10aee19555c-b4/s540x810/2456deb75e5b5188bc6f8599dbdbb629504479f3.jpg" data-orig-height="1333" data-orig-width="1000"/></figure><p>Love and other indoor sports,<br/>L xxxx<br/></p><p>(source: received this email)</p>

Title: (from admin) Welcome!
<p>I’m so excited for making this page! I’ve always had trouble searching for her emails since I only joined the mailing list early 2019. So I decided to make this little page to archive all of the emails I’ve gotten and others I’ve found.</p><p>Please bare with me, this is my first time creating a “formal” page in Tumblr. I’ll be posting all of her emails up until her most recent ones little by little. I have habilitated a “Tips here!” section in which you can all send me any tips/recommendations on any missing info.</p><p>I’ll be taking any old emails from anywhere I can find them, and will credit the source below each post. I will also try to attach any media Lorde sent along the emails.</p><p>Hope all of this goes as well as it looks in my mind!</p><p>A fellow Lorde fan ♡</p><p>p.s. : también hablo español!</p>

<h1>A very busy little girl!</h1><p>(07/30/2021) (Solar Institute Bulletin No. 4) (From Undisclosed Paradise)</p><p>Good morning to you.<br/>I managed to escape the city. Work the last couple weeks has been a blur of interviews, photo shoots, trips to 30 Rock, the whole bit. I keep having this funny sensation of being INSIDE the internet— I feel the actual aspect ratio of the Youtube video I’m making, like a doll in a diorama. Feeling more settled though, and doing lots of funny fun shit every day. Right now, I’m here and I can hear cicadas.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1335" data-orig-width="1000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d61158f420ea1c10da08a69f182ffe2c/cdf8dda7f00a1578-eb/s2048x3072/aa484075678b8b269d401cbe412e8aba703d7d80.jpg" data-orig-height="1335" data-orig-width="1000" data-media-key="d61158f420ea1c10da08a69f182ffe2c:cdf8dda7f00a1578-eb" alt="image"/></figure><p>I’m really enjoying the deep weirdness and analogue nature of this outlet.

But among those we commonly call berries, we eat just four: strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. There’s a reason the other varieties rarely reach us. Sometimes the fruit rots within days after picking (salmonberries), or the plant puts out fruit for only a few weeks in summer (cloudberries). Sometimes the plant doesn’t produce much fruit at all or is too thorny or sprawling for the fruit to be picked without a vast amount of labor. As Joel Reiner, a horticulturalist at Pairwise, would later put it, “Berries always have some tragic flaw.”<br/><br/>She had a busy week. More soon.<br/>Wishing you continued enjoyment of the summer months, and health and well-being for all your family members.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Take it easy, but take it—<br/>Ella</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1499" data-orig-width="1000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d958128110d2701c66bd287167a8650/cdf8dda7f00a1578-d1/s2048x3072/5dcf8295b271c435e93d6c80ab1a88edf2612487.jpg" data-orig-height="1499" data-orig-width="1000" data-media-key="6d958128110d2701c66bd287167a8650:cdf8dda7f00a1578-d1" alt="image"/></figure><p>(source: received this email)</p>

<h1>Dissociation whilst getting pedicures</h1><p>(07/21/2021) (Solar Institute Bulletin No. 3) (From New York City)</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1194" data-orig-width="927"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/630f188cb69d19df0788d508b0fedf96/0d40259e0e1f06b0-4c/s2048x3072/fb561869c667200922ec07c3088933deededd676.jpg" data-orig-height="1194" data-orig-width="927" data-media-key="630f188cb69d19df0788d508b0fedf96:0d40259e0e1f06b0-4c"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Pomegranates, Majorca” by John Singer Sargent </p><p>Hello my mates. I hope you’re doing good out there. I’ve just gotten back from a crazy amazing shoot in the middle of nowhere that I can’t tell you anything about yet, surprise surprise, but that you’ll see soon and — I’ll put money on this — shit your pants over. It was very very intense and amazing, and then it was over and we were driving back through the redwoods, and I was sitting in the back of a sprinter van with my feet up on the seat like a naughty teen, shaking my head that this is my life. It’s something I keep going on and on about, I know, but it’s just so insane, the contrast between home and here. I’ve been trading the tour bus for the grocery store line over and over since I was sixteen (I’ll probably do it forever), and a couple of years ago I realised it was time to write about those two sides to my life. I started writing this in the first six months after stopping touring for Melo. I was so tired by the end, I’d been so busy for so long, and I remember at the end of that tour saying to people I knew “I’m just going to go home and get bored” — because it had been two years since I had been at a loose end, bored out of my brain going from the couch to the fridge, and I was craving that. The first couple months of it were incredible— I’d run a bath at 10am and eat a slice of cake in it! My bandmate Jimmy and I would go out for these long lunches on Mondays and drink wine! But eventually, of course, the insecurity that this was my life now, that I wasn’t a titan of industry, but someone who just… cooked and walked the dog and gardened crept in. I was starting to fall out of step with the times culturally, I didn’t have my finger firmly on the pulse for the first time in my life, and I could feel the next round of precocious teenagers starting to come up, and I felt insecure that they were gonna eat my lunch, so to speak. Was I over the hill?!! This song was borne out of that feeling. I was sure that I was building a beautiful life for myself, but I wasn’t sure if that life was going to satisfy the same thirsty, fearless person who could tear apart a festival stage or be in seven countries in seven days. I know now that as hard as I try to run towards or away one of the sides of my life, they’re both very much who I am. It’s jarring to move between them, but that dichotomy is me. And writing this song was a real step toward embracing that. It’s almost comical to be writing this from a hotel room where my life is busier than ever, my iCal is wall to wall from wake to sleep, and of course I’m daydreaming about cooking and gardening and romanticising the greener grass once again… SO IT GOES.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1908" data-orig-width="1428"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1ced9816cfa0cbcf84f5c138bb3cab77/0d40259e0e1f06b0-8f/s2048x3072/010cd328889feb787e96b41769523c10378ed120.jpg" data-orig-height="1908" data-orig-width="1428" data-media-key="1ced9816cfa0cbcf84f5c138bb3cab77:0d40259e0e1f06b0-8f"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1280" data-orig-width="720" data-npf='{"type":"video","provider":"tumblr","url":"https://va.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_qxu6wzJZjg1zqlvz0.mp4","media":{"url":"https://va.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_qxu6wzJZjg1zqlvz0.mp4","type":"video/mp4","width":720,"height":1280},"poster":[{"media_key":"ec258d8092c19babcb531740ee4e835e:a64b05f2b07ce27b-22","type":"image/jpeg","width":456,"height":810}]}'><video controls="controls" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted" poster="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec258d8092c19babcb531740ee4e835e/a64b05f2b07ce27b-22/s2048x3072/64aa99fe11cc38e191a9bc9a77acecb517a1c4a8.jpg"><source src="https://va.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_qxu6wzJZjg1zqlvz0.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video></figure><p>I brought the kernel for this into Jack’s home studio on the same trip as Solar Power.

This Lowell Hardwick letters collection might actually warrant its own newsletter, but I thought of this quote from Lowell in it about Nail Salon today — “In the best art, as in life, all the blood-veins go to the heart.”</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1335" data-orig-width="1000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6e1b41699dee7e9f79446dfb16cd0343/0d40259e0e1f06b0-72/s2048x3072/912f63d292b709c123f570d1b322d9a382f8a872.jpg" data-orig-height="1335" data-orig-width="1000" data-media-key="6e1b41699dee7e9f79446dfb16cd0343:0d40259e0e1f06b0-72"/></figure><p>SCWWTS Paulo sent in this sweet photo of a baby duck that you must see!!!!!!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1061" data-orig-width="1061"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/922e55db12e017f4524fe7bba7ded5dd/0d40259e0e1f06b0-64/s2048x3072/f8039cd4dcf20dd984f00c001bea82417961a1a7.jpg" data-orig-height="1061" data-orig-width="1061" data-media-key="922e55db12e017f4524fe7bba7ded5dd:0d40259e0e1f06b0-64"/></figure><p>Hello to 13-year-old SCWWTS Anna from Jamaica— I love knowing that you’re cranking SP over there :—)<br/><br/>SCWWTS Tostiloco wanted to know my favourite flavour of ice cream. It’s pistachio.<br/><br/>SCWWTS Laura asked me about my favourite hikes, and told me about some of hers, and said this amazing thing about the geography near where she lives near the Santa Cruz mountains: “It’s sandy because millions of years ago the mountains were at the bottom of the ocean!” Wow.<br/><br/>Lastly, SCWWTS Aldana asked for tips on how to maintain one’s spicy summer energy through the winter. Sis, firstly, I feeeeel you on this. I’ve kind of run away from winter in New Zealand for the past two years which is NAUGHTY OF ME I KNOW IT HAPPENS FOR A REASON but I’m in such an endless summer state of mind and can’t resist. Obviously my life is very charmed and specific and not everyone can do that, so my tips are as follows—<br/>*Rug up and go for a walk if you can bear it. I always feel better feeling some clear air, even if it’s freezing. This works especially well on a non-rainy day. If it’s a rainy day, I’d honestly just stay inside and make a nice pot of soup. I feel personally attacked by rain.<br/>*Invite your girlfriends round, turn the heat up really high in your house if you have heat, wear sexy summer dresses and make like really summery tequila-based drinks and apply skincare, it’ll be for your chapped winter face but you could imagine that it’s sunscreen. Idk I’ve never done this but it sounds fun.<br/>*Check the upcoming weather for sunny days. Even if it’s cold, you should do your best to UTILISE this winter sun. Go for a chilly walk before work, drive to a beach on the weekend, sit with the sun on your face with giant scarves and coats entombing the rest of your body even! I went on a winter beach weekend with some friends last summer, one minute we were walking on the beach in puffer jackets and all of a sudden the sun came out and next minute we were in our underwear in the water!!! Anything could happen!!<br/>*Buy yellow flowers from the bodega/dairy/newsagent/corner store. Yellow flowers always help. I like chrysanthemums and parrot tulips and cymbidium.<br/><br/>Okay byeeee for now enjoy the song <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=b09ff6cc65&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">here</a>!</p><p>(source: received this email)</p>

Another weird moment of culture shock onset shooting a thing (which I’ll maybe be able to share in next newsletter!) outdoors, everyone was sweating in jean shorts, looking like people, and I was wearing an archive Prada bolero top, hair and makeup pristine. I felt like a freak, you know? Like a fancy little goldfish in her own special bowl. I know you know this, but pop star world is ridiculous and extravagant and excessive and very looks-focused, and I’m reminded of the deep oddness when I’ve been away from it for a while.<br/>Anyway. Been going on long walks around the city, which is at its most juicy and delicious and vibrant, going to the studio when I can, starting to talk to journalists and shoot stuff and generally start to become the physical embodiment of my work. Lots of the time, I feel like a brain in a jar, or like this drawing of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s called the transparent eyeball (which I highly recommend you Google, because it’s very much a Solar Power guiding light), but around this time, I’m reminded that I do in fact live in a body that people can see, and it helps communicate and symbolise the work I’ve made. So trying to walk a lot, look at people and things and generally (I hate this phrase every time anyone uses it and I’m inviting you to hate me now) ground myself, and each day that passes sees me become a little more in it, a little less shy about everything and a little more ready to invite you in. Really, I want you to have the whole album tomorrow. But we’ll get to all that.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1037" data-orig-height="1737" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ce43b816f4ad59e641643b054733156e/4f0c75cd3dc3d541-d8/s540x810/b237accc9c76402a7c3ad58459a7dc9fdb910830.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1037" data-orig-height="1737"/></figure><p>I was up late last night, scrolling through the Notes folder on my iPhone. Notes has become sort of this mythical zone for the modern songwriter, as with Voice Memos, and it’s true — we are all writing every fucking song using these two applications. When i think about any romantic notions I may have had as a kid of writing my songs elegantly in a notebook with pen, I laugh. The truth is, my written hand is really slow. Typing is the fastest I can get something out, and speed is key. But my Notes app also functions as a sort of interesting time capsule— I can see lists of groceries or Christmas gifts I needed to buy years ago alongside deep thoughts about where I’m at and what I’m making as they start to form. I took some screenshots last night, cause I thought it could be of vague interest to you.<br/><br/>Starting here, late 2018. Hadn’t started writing anything for this album, but having thoughts about it. And starting to hate being online.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="643" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/096934f1a689fb0587c83a2a411f79ca/4f0c75cd3dc3d541-4a/s540x810/a6d602496cbff74494539894db31be684b3a83e1.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="643"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="873" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0b584212931609d151fd46d6932c5f19/4f0c75cd3dc3d541-f7/s540x810/79549b2c47103d965679a798abc3e62004dcbd0e.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="873"/></figure><p>Thinking more about myself as a domestic person, a partner, a mother.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="802" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b30c7bf76635a6d6e4652a6fb5ff95e3/4f0c75cd3dc3d541-67/s540x810/82ef57a01527e777b8353d95e8f00db98d0bb7eb.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="802"/></figure><p>Driving back from Matapouri and going through one of those full roaring tunnels of cicada sound, it striking a deep chord.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="498" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/72ef3b5ecfb597ec228fc81f5103d983/4f0c75cd3dc3d541-21/s540x810/063fa3dab06014872892d31062e05ea5bd391eb4.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="498"/></figure><p>Starting to conceptualise — again, this is before any music has really been written… Maybe I had one song.

It was a pool day, but the light is starting to fade and people are getting hungry, so I change out of my swimsuit into something light, a vintage Dries slip maybe, apply a slick of tinted gloss, and start laying out little dishes of Castelvetrano olives and pickled fennel and sardines and this sheep’s cheese called Devotion, isn’t that a great name for a cheese, and rummage around in the fridge for what to cook.<br/>The garden is exploding, a riot of flowers and bees, the small space seeming taller than it is wide. Someone turns on the festoon bulbs that overhang the swimming pool, and music starts to play. Everyone switches to mezcal. I walk outside to the Weber, light it, feel the house and garden start to subtly change gears. I grill zucchini and halloumi and too-juicy nectarines, watching the char marks darken. Tall beeswax candles are lit. The lady of the house consumes an edible. Someone puts on an old song, someone else says, “Oh my God, I haven’t heard this since (…)” Two girls standing up by the piano start to dance, holding their hands out to each other, laughing — it’s just dinner on a summer’s night, but the world is just starting to tilt. Later, we’ll all be faded dancing in each other’s arms somewhere, but for now everything’s still light, shoes are off and sundresses are on and the night is all potential.<br/>That’s how the show is gonna feel.</p><p><br/>Anyway, here’s the <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=aba327a107&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">presale code</a>: <b>strangeairlines</b></p><p><br/>L x</p><p>(source: received this email)</p>

Title: 
<h2>HAPPY SUMMER SOLSTICE</h2><p>(06/21/2021) (Solar Institute Bulletin No. 1)</p><p>Greetings my babies, and happy solstice.<br/>For those who don’t know, the summer solstice is the day when the Sun charts her longest course through the sky. It’s the longest and most light day of the year. Cultures have celebrated the solstice for thousands of years— with singing, dancing, ceremonies, fires, and feasts. It’s a day to toast fertility and hope for plentiful harvests. It’s one worth celebrating.</p><p>And what better way to celebrate than with an EXTENSIVE DETAILS BULLETIN? (I’m joking, please go outside after reading this). I have so much to tell you.<br/>This is the first official bulletin from the Solar Institute, by the way. These may come every week or two weeks, depending on how I feel.</p><p>Firstly, thankyou for your sweet vibes on SP. I’m glad you like it. On release morning I went up Ōwairaka, not far from my house — I wanted to be outside. This is from the minute before the song launched.</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1338" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/909f175934bbbe4bf922c0cac50f68d8/5e8d3b41760664ce-dd/s540x810/a14830cf4cb4f5a0680e38c1a9fc34568b2c2bc3.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1338" data-media-key="909f175934bbbe4bf922c0cac50f68d8:5e8d3b41760664ce-dd"/></figure><p>I had friends round that night, my girls brought me yellow flowers, I drank a really delicious mezcal and felt happy and cozy. It’s kind of an insane feeling having music out again. I can feel people staring at me when I go places. I’m getting really good tables in restaurants all of a sudden. It’s very amusing to me that to so many people I was dead, and now I’m alive!!!</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="462" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/282164948dd38f75aac0666828a66ed4/5e8d3b41760664ce-68/s540x810/d9a510951d871f6f3670bfffe5403998b2613538.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="462" data-media-key="282164948dd38f75aac0666828a66ed4:5e8d3b41760664ce-68"/></figure><p>Anyway. I have some major shit to announce so I gotta keep this moving. </p><p>The album comes out August 20. It contains 12 songs and 2 bonus tracks. Here’s the tracklist:</p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1500" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/675d9fe53f17669d82122b871531d043/5e8d3b41760664ce-ed/s540x810/12db595b3b8caee6922f9e94b2a8767a32ccf88e.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1500" data-media-key="675d9fe53f17669d82122b871531d043:5e8d3b41760664ce-ed"/></figure><p>It’s available for <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=7694ab6872&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">preorder/presave/whatever</a> it’s called NOW. We have made some absolutely sensational vinyls for you guys that you will be able to go and get the day the album comes out, no waiting for you, oh no! They’ve waited long enough, I told my team, shaking my finger (really, my team told ME, because I live basically on a different planet and need to be reminded of real-world parameters constantly!!)<br/>There’s a beautiful <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.store/products/solar-power-standard-vinyl">standard vinyl</a> with a sky-blue disc, and a very juicy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210621192348/https://lorde.store/products/solar-power-d2c-exclusive-deluxe-vinyl">deluxe vinyl</a> only available <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=9131d39e4e&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">on my site</a> with the sickest giant foldout poster (you get the bonus tracks with this, on a super cool 7-inch picture disc). No CDs this time. I didn’t wanna make something that would end up in a landfill in 2 years, but more than that, I wanted to make something that symbolised my commitment to asking questions of our systems, and making stuff with intention and sensitivity.<br/>I’m calling it a <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.store/products/solar-power-music-box-discless-product">music box</a>. It’ll be the same size and shape as a CD, and you can buy it where CDs live, but this is something totally different. If you’re torn on which hold-in-your-hands, flip-through-the-pages thing to buy to best enjoy this album, honestly, I’d go for the music box. You’ll know more about this very soon. </p><p>Onward we go!! No time to waste! More information to deliver! Didn’t I say this was gonna be a big one! </p><p>I’m also announcing <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=fe2368271f&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">THE SOLAR POWER TOUR</a>. Here’s the poster:</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1300" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5df970425b55e265b9e5582d828a13e2/5e8d3b41760664ce-8c/s540x810/2d14bfb396b4a5b90b4f937b433de7fedf962f07.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1300" data-media-key="5df970425b55e265b9e5582d828a13e2:5e8d3b41760664ce-8c"/></figure><p>This is gonna be such a sick tour. We’ve just hired five new band members&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br/>This is, thrillingly, something of an <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=c797350a6f&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">INTIMATE TOUR</a>. Theatres and green fields rather than arenas. So you gotta get in there if you really wanna go. I’m gonna send a special mailing-list-only code to you on Wednesday that’ll ensure you beat the scalpers to our dance party. I’ve been told to tell you that pre-sale for the UK, Europe &amp; North American shows starts “this Thursday, 10am local time” (no idea what this means). New Zealand and Australia, your pre-sale starts next Wednesday the 30th. All the details are <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=553d7dadd3&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">HERE</a>.</p><p>The rumours are true — I’m not gonna be returning to social media this cycle, outside of the occasional temporary post, I guess. Being off social media makes me feel incredible — we can talk more about that another time — and I’d love to maintain feeling that good, and also build this really cool new zone with you guys. I want this bulletin to be our special spot. I see it as being part news bulletin, part diary, part old-school fan site. In time I’ll post interviews with people I admire, random photos of my garden, meandering thoughts on myriad concepts, backstage tour pics, recipes, etc etc etc etc etc. I know it’s a different sort of pace to what you’re probably used to, and much more long-form, but I’m looking forward to retraining our brains together :-)</p><p>I’ve also decided to create a zone where we can chat. I realised people were replying to these emails asking how I was doing, what I was up to, etc. Which is very sweet! And I’d love to write back!<br/>In a move borrowed lovingly from the Opulent Tips newsletter, I’ve decided that if you’re still reading this, you’re probably a sensitive cutie who worships the sun (SCWWTS). I look forward to answering a question or so per bulletin from other SCsWWTS, continuing to chat with the freaks I know and love, and making the acquaintance of many more!</p><p>Okay. That’s it for now. Drink a big water. Go outside.</p><p>E x</p><p>(source: received this email)</p>

She’s sexy, playful, feral, and free. She’s a modern girl in a deadstock bikini, in touch with her past and her future, vibrating at the highest level when summer comes around. Her skin is glowing, her lovers are many. I’m completely obsessed with her, and soon you will be too.<br/></p><p>It’s my divine pleasure to be introducing you, at long last, to my third studio album, SOLAR POWER.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="1200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/abc9c1027e35fc5e17b3043145fc3bfa/9a903390c09e2713-d0/s540x810/ddd8a6c4954c33c31ba29699bc71b37704fbdcdc.jpg" data-orig-height="1200" data-orig-width="1200"/></figure><p>The album is a celebration of the natural world, an attempt at immortalising the deep, transcendent feelings I have when I’m outdoors. In times of heartache, grief, deep love, or confusion, I look to the natural world for answers. I’ve learnt to breathe out, and tune in. This is what came through.</p><p>The first song, also called <a href="https://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=27ba3ada7f&amp;e=2a26f8a4a9">SOLAR POWER</a> and written and produced by myself and Jack, is the first of the rays. It’s about that infectious, flirtatious summer energy that takes hold of us all, come June (or December, if you’re a Southern Hemisphere baby like me but I know that’s literally IMPOSSIBLE for you all to wrap your little heads around so don’t worry about it!!).</p><p>I made everything with friends here in New Zealand. My best mate Ophelia took the cover photo, lying on the sand as I leapt over her, both of us laughing. The director who made my first ever music video, Joel, helped me create the videos, building an entire cinematic universe that I can’t wait for you to see. I made something that encapsulates where I’m from — my family, my girlfriends, my outdoors, my constant ruminations, and my unending search for the divine.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="356" data-orig-height="200" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwvsP_lzh2-8"><iframe width="540" height="303" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvsP_lzh2-8?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>There’s SO much more detail to come — a truly comical amount of detail, honestly. You can look to the natural calendar for clues. I’m trying to listen to what’s out there more, and the vibe I got was that you’re ready for this, that you need it.

Title: AN ALTERNATE REALM
<p>(11/24/2020)</p><p>Hello you,<br/><br/>How’re you doing out there? Is it getting cold where you are, or warm like it is here? The beginning of summer is my favourite time in New Zealand, and this year in particular it feels like a gift — I’ve had two swims, and even eaten the first tomatoes. My container garden is established— this year I’ve got French beans, English and snow peas, tomatoes, Thai chillis, various herbs, rocket, mesclun, Malabar spinach, zucchini and cucumbers (I’m gonna be so fuckin stoked if those pop off; please send feedback on if the mailing list recipients want to see the results???!!). I’m thinking of my friends and loved ones experiencing opposite conditions in other parts of the world, keeping indoors, lighting candles and tightening circles. Hang in there, buds. You could watch the Queen’s Gambit, or Chinatown; give yourself a pedicure; listen to a Talking Heads album; go for a walk. These things help.<br/><br/>Well. I’m here in your inbox because I have some exciting news. Not that news. Don’t get too excited. Just a moderate amount.<br/><br/>In early 2019 I took a trip to Antarctica, funded and facilitated by the lovely folks at Antarctica New Zealand. The continent has fascinated me since I was old enough to read. It started to interest me again in recent years as my environmental awareness went up and up, and questions about how to change my personal and professional footprints on this earth occupied much of my time.<br/>I was accompanied down there by my beautiful friend Harriet Were, who photographed our days, lugging all these cameras and lenses and film — yup, she shot completely on film in Antarctica — around in the snow. And the pictures turned out so beautiful, I thought it was only right to make them into a little catalogue-style book, alongside a piece of writing I did about my experience on the frozen continent. It’s called GOING SOUTH, and it’s a softcover book with over 100 pages of photos and writing.<br/><br/>When I went to Antarctica, I hadn’t yet started writing again after finishing Melodrama. I realised after the trip that what my brain had been craving was a visit to an alternate realm. Albums live in their own realms in a way, and Antarctica really acted as this great white palette cleanser, a sort of celestial foyer I had to move through in order to start making the next thing. In the plane coming down to land, I had this very intense bolt-of-lightning thought, which in all its eloquence was literally ‘DON’T MAKE SHIT RECORDS’, lol. I’ll always hold this trip up as a life highlight for many reasons, but I’m particularly grateful for it as one that showed me the beginnings of the new world which I continue to build, and am very excited to start showing you soon.<br/><br/>The book is a sort of perfect precursor to this album in an abstract way, and it’s a cool little piece of the Lorde cinematic universe for you to own if you’d like to. We’re doing preorders to get an idea of how many to produce, so it won’t arrive for Christmas I wouldn’t think, but the first 500 will come with a special picture postcard, signed by yours truly down here at the bottom of the world.<br/><br/>All net proceeds from the sale of this book will go towards a scholarship fund for an Antarctica New Zealand postgraduate scholar to study the science of climate change. Imagine if we could put someone through a climate-related PhD with this little book! It’s almost too awesome to think about.<br/><br/>Okay, that’s about all for now. I’ll put a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201125004653/https://lorde.store/products/going-south-book-s">link to the preorder here</a>. Sending all of my love, all the time.<br/><br/>L x<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1508" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff475cc4c01452ffad7036ce127f3b7a/a1bd15d464bc841f-b8/s540x810/bcf11a25ea132468b9c414e532b898991e84581a.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="1508"/></figure><p>(source: received this email)</p>

<p>(06/01/2020)</p><p>Hello again,<br/>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking — &ldquo;Two notes in two weeks? Who is she?!&rdquo; You probably weren&rsquo;t expecting to hear from me for another few months, but I can&rsquo;t ask for your attention one week and go silent on something like this the next. So here goes.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been following this week&rsquo;s events in the States from New Zealand. I also attended the peaceful protest in Auckland today to support the Black Lives Matter movement. One of the things I find most frustrating about social media is performative activism, predominantly by white celebrities (like me). It&rsquo;s hard to strike a balance between self-serving social media displays and true action. But part of being an ally is knowing when to speak and when to listen, and I know that white silence right now is more damaging than someone&rsquo;s wack protest selfie.</p><p>So let me be clear: this ongoing systemic brutality by police is racist, it&rsquo;s sickening, and it&rsquo;s unsurprising. As someone who has made art directly inspired by and in conversation with hip hop, it&rsquo;s my responsibility to let you know that I&rsquo;m here. I extend that sentiment to all my fellow musicians and producers who have tightened a snare to make it more trap, who&rsquo;ve drawn a pattern of high hats in Pro Tools because they heard something similar in a hip hop song and it made them feel big and cool. We have a responsibility to let our affected listeners know that we&rsquo;re with them when it&rsquo;s hard too, not just when it's easy. Not just when we benefit. We see you, and we&rsquo;re here.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still learning the nuances of all this. I&rsquo;m still working out how to practise activism while refraining from social media. Numbers at protests and mass gatherings speak loudly, hopefully lead to eventual legislative change, so I do that. Money helps concretely, paying things like bail funds to free unjustly held activists, so I do that. I don&rsquo;t feel completely comfortable posting donation links<br/>asking you for money - I don&rsquo;t know what kind of financial situation you&rsquo;re in right now. It&rsquo;s on me to use my resources resources you gave me, directly or indirectly - to donate on your behalf.</p><p>To my black and brown listeners -<br/>I&rsquo;m so sorry this is your reality, that you haven&rsquo;t had a choice but to be defined by this, to give it your energy. I&rsquo;m aware of that tax on you. I hope white people you know are doing what they can to ease your load. And I really, really hope systems will change to better protect you.</p><p>Black Lives Matter.</p><p><br/>L</p><p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/mayor-jacob-frey-justice-for-george-floyd">https://www.change.org/p/mayor-jacob-frey-justice-for-george-floyd</a><br/></p><p>(source: <a href="https://twitter.com/Lorde_fix/status/1267362043624951809">https://twitter.com/Lorde_fix/status/1267362043624951809</a>)</p>

I realised the other day it had been a minute since we chatted, and I was missing you. Do you wear your hair long or short now? Did you take your piercings out? You’ll probably be pleased to know my hair is big and long again. I think after Melodrama came out I said I wouldn’t put out another record until my hair was long— both because hair takes time to grow, and I knew I needed time, and because I knew the next record would require the longest and wildest hair yet. In many cultures and religions throughout history, long hair has been viewed as a source of power and a link to the spiritual world, and I can certainly say that I have never felt more spiritually rich, and in touch with the voices that guide.<br/>(Yes I’m a fucking herb. Sue me!!!)<br/><br/>I hope you and your friends and family are staying safe. It’s a wild time. I don’t know how many times I’ve said that in the past two months.<br/>New Zealand is creeping back to normal. Shops and restaurants are open again. I’ve seen some friends. I feel so grateful for such calm, sensible leadership by our government, now more than ever. I know you may not be afforded that where you live, and I hope you’re taking it one day at a time and trying not to feel too destroyed by the news. I’m thinking of you all the time.<br/>It’s that time of year in New Zealand where it’s cold and clear. The light is bright and stark, with lots of contrasting shadows. The sky is the dark bright blue which signals approaching winter.<br/>The cars are back on the roads, which is a bit of a weird thing. The quiet streets had given me a glimpse at a different city, one where I could hear the sparrows in the huge London plane trees at rush hour. Maybe one day we’ll be back there again. I don’t know.<br/><br/>The first three months of this year started as a blur, and began to sharpen. It was summer, a time of year which is usually so clarifying and special to me, but I was grieving hard for Pearl, carrying it everywhere with me. I found a note in my phone from November which said:<br/><br/>I eat a grief sandwich<br/>I wear a grief coat<br/>I see a grief film.<br/><br/>If you know how it feels to lose someone close, I’m sure that makes sense to you. Everything about you becomes a grief thing! The dreamy warm time of year I normally love so much — the beaches and the green fields — it all felt hollow without my boy beside me.<br/>I started going back to the studio again in December, just for something to do, and to my surprise, good things came out. Happy, playful things. I felt my melodic muscles flexing and strengthening. Jack came over to work in the studio in Auckland, and I went to LA. It flowed. A thing started to take shape. And then, of course, the world shut down. We’re still working away — Jack and I FaceTimed for over an hour this morning going over everything. But it’ll take a while longer.</p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/34baf53a3982c14907ded94167bcfb83/6f780c2a1b38c98b-5f/s540x810/7e156ee6270e11ddd1a3fa801ed4dd46fb2d9e3c.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1024"/></figure><p>Studio Jack, late 2019<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1003" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/729bffc25aa44b2bb40ee1889b40dc81/6f780c2a1b38c98b-da/s540x810/c51cecf028d35c8c2bdbe2f59799589bc4dc3ba3.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1003"/></figure><p>Studio me by jack</p><p>I’ve been looking at some of your notes online, and I can feel the (extremely sweet, EXTREMELY flattering) desperation creeping back into your voices. You need it! The thing can’t come soon enough! I understand— I want nothing more than to feed you treats, pop perfect morsels straight into your little mouths. But as I get older I realise there’s something to be said for the pleasant feeling of waiting for something of quality to become available to you. You could have something of lesser quality much faster, but as the high quality thing comes into fruition, a warm feeling grows inside you. Do you know what I mean? I get this feeling when I make bread, or put my seedlings in after the last frost, or even when I wait for a particular package to arrive. Waiting, the thing that felt so pointless and annoying when I was young, is now this kind of delicious activity. In my opinion, the greatest treat I can give you is work that will last ten, twenty, thirty years. And that kind of work takes time. So if you can, I’d like for you to try tuning in to the time spent waiting for something of the highest quality to arrive. Enjoy the sensation as it builds. When the moment comes, our wave will crest super fucking high.<br/><br/>I can tell you, this new thing, it’s got its own colours now. If you know anything about my work, you’ll know what that means.<br/><br/>I knew I needed a break from touring at the end of the last cycle. I was finding the combination of brutal stage fright and having no fixed home and no connection with what I ate or where I lived extremely grim. I needed to make some food, grow some stuff, go to the beach a bunch, finally acknowledge (and kick) my social media addiction. I wasn’t sure if I’d tour again for a long time. And I still don’t know what touring is gonna look like for me, sensitive sweet pea plant that I am. But I know now how excited I am to get back out there. I want to be playing festivals again — hearing my intro music, watching the band walk onstage. I want to devastate. I want to see a huge line of you outside my hotel. I want to hug you all, and hold your hands. I want to do interviews, talk about the record over and over until I know it inside out. I want to do photoshoots, make videos. I want to eat summer foods in beautiful countries — ice cream and tomatoes and anchovies. I want to use my gift, and watch it grow. Who knows when it’ll be safe to do those things, but I’m craving them, and I wanted you to know.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things about when we meet is the hug we almost always share. You say, “Can I hug you?” in a wavering voice, and I reach out my arms and hold you close for 10 or 15 seconds. Our hands rest on each others’ backs. In those few seconds I can feel all the love and care you have for my work, all the time you’ve spent listening and watching and decoding. And you can feel how deeply I care about you, how hard I try to make everything perfect so that I meet your hopes where they are.<br/>When it’s safe, I can’t wait to hug you again.<br/><br/>The work is so fucking good, my friend. I am truly jazzed for you to hear it.<br/><br/>Okay, that’s all for now. It’s mid afternoon, and really warm. I’m going to put on my new shirt and walk down to the water. Fish and fennel salad for dinner. I hope this finds you well.<br/><br/>L xxxxxx<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa99f4d4739d697ff96fc47e6e16a6f7/6f780c2a1b38c98b-5b/s540x810/37c063a3b58c5a06acfe2e723e356dce36cd55de.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1024"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c7d336419c9b1177630febf2b4dce2f4/6f780c2a1b38c98b-fe/s540x810/8bc35c5aec37eff40525ee58b8b65c1e5815c886.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="1024"/></figure><p>St Bathans, February 2020<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="2000" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/81429710e21ca2f28ea0e2a4a61c96b4/6f780c2a1b38c98b-c3/s540x810/b812d5931a0a78cc2db38ab858eea0fab519b3a3.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="2000"/></figure><p>The photo I took last week (for the super sleuths)</p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="2000" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/65eba78c97fbfad65aaa84d4eb5610c1/6f780c2a1b38c98b-c4/s540x810/2005ab1445abf6f0bd569b9b3bd7999b32e65b63.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="2000"/></figure><p>Lockdown monarch on my lime tree<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="1500" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/51c8a555a21048aa5fd801f218c3664a/6f780c2a1b38c98b-68/s540x810/f42a9a301cb2c207ef446a74db006b60429a36cd.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="1500"/></figure><p>Lockdown light on water<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="1500" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3f5e73ace5a6a9aefb2a34635432b9df/6f780c2a1b38c98b-3d/s540x810/c8b234e8ffa4c6af57f18d474b1122b6361509e2.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="1500"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="1500" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2b23e13bcb24ad80d799f3a0dbdf3e0b/6f780c2a1b38c98b-b1/s540x810/033c882e9e4e1451fcfc1b6e3bbe0ff88a9c3936.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1125" data-orig-height="1500"/></figure><p>Lockdown rhubarb galette (I’m refraining from sharing any more food content)<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="2000" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/580b0a2d02bafeddf097d3619b71477a/6f780c2a1b38c98b-ed/s540x810/0b96bdad55931b2a1b655d84d6a0c6b9cf1798ac.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="2000"/></figure><p>The author at time of writing<br/></p><p>(source: received this email)</p>

Title: To my friends
<p>(11/02/2019)</p><p>To my friends,<br/><br/>I’m writing this letter to you because it’s always been my intention to be transparent with you about my life and what happens to me. When we first met I would write little notes for you online, and they would form a big map that you would use to chart the constellations in my work. I realised a couple of years ago that I needed to rethink my relationship with posting random shit online all the time, so here we are, a little less in contact than we once were. You are no less beloved by me, or thought of. I think of you all often, in high points and in low ones, and the kindness you have shown me over the last 6 or 7 years (I’m going to be 23 next week, if you can believe it).<br/><br/>I’ve been working away on the new songs for most of this year in New Zealand. It’s been going pretty well, but something happened last month that I need to tell you about. <br/><br/>Some of you may know about Pearl, my dog. Pearl came into my life in 2018, and almost immediately changed everything for me. As anyone who has had the pleasure of raising a dog can understand, my life grew exponentially. Pearl brought an immeasurable amount of joy and purpose into my world. Love vibrated all around us. I felt my life growing and swelling in healthfulness, this orb of contentment glowing around me and Pearl, and our family. We spent almost all our time alone together, him asleep under the piano as I played, or on the porch together, or in the park, where he became a blurry speck of gold in the green, far away. After years on the road, I spent a lot of time at home, growing things, making food slowly, writing. I was receiving huge amounts of energy I can only describe as divine, and I was working hard to communicate it all to you by way of the album. I felt I had been given this great gift that I needed to share with you all. <br/><br/>Pearl had been ill in various forms his entire life. It was a long process of figuring out what this illness was, and after he dropped some weight over a few weeks in October, a kind specialist finally honed in on the problem. I was giving Pearl the medicines to get him back on track, and everything was looking good. <br/><br/>But one day we woke up and I knew, in that way mothers do, that he was sicker than we had realised, and that we were nearing a point where his body wasn’t going to be able to cope. I rushed him to the specialists. Pearl had two cardiac arrests about an hour apart, and after the second one, he died. I was holding him when he went, and I know he knew that I was there. But this loss has been indescribably painful, and a light that was turned on for me has gone out. <br/><br/>Pearl visits me in my dreams, and I am able to see or hold him for a brief time most nights. But the bright energy I was trying to communicate to you has gone, for now. He was instrumental to the discovery that was taking place. I felt he led me towards the ideas. And it’s going to take some time and recalibration, now that there’s no shepherd ahead of me, to see what the work is going to be. <br/><br/>So I’m asking for your patience, as 2020 comes around and you start to wonder where the next record is. I have lost my boy, and I need some time to see the good again, to finish making this for you. It won’t be the same work— as anyone who has felt loss can understand, there’s a door that opens that you step through, and everything is different on the other side. But when this great loss crystallises inside me, and my chest rebuilds around it, hopefully I’ll be able to finish up, and share it with you, and we’ll all grow together, as we always do.<br/><br/>Thankyou for your kindness, today and every day. I feel it. <br/><br/>Ella<br/></p><p>(source: received this email)</p>

Title: A little photo for my friends
<p>(08/01/2019)</p><p>Hello there, it’s me — <br/><br/>Been a while since we last spoke. I hope you’re having a great summer, and that you’ve been able to take some time to be outdoors. I recommend a walk to breathe in greenery and listen to the insects, an early morning rise looking out at the ocean, or if you’re in a city, a drink with ice in it, enjoyed in the warm summer dark. Wanted to share a happy photo of myself, taken on Martha’s Vineyard in a friend’s beautiful vege garden a couple of weeks ago. We decided that if I was a vegetable I would be a leek :-) <br/><br/>Miss you. Sending love <br/><br/>L xx<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1500" data-orig-width="2000"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/9bd35ff27be2ad2c5230367da91a43b3/86f44d3bd4701a9a-56/s540x810/dacee2e15cdff3182144501e5f2d5c8d151a80ae.jpg" data-orig-height="1500" data-orig-width="2000"/></figure><p>(source: received this email)</p>

<h1>!MERCH!</h1><p>(12/13/2018)</p><p>Hi again!</p><p>As promised, two commemorative merch pieces to celebrate the end of Melo, available for <a href="https://href.li/?https://lorde.store/">preorder now</a> til the end of the year. One super-cool crew neck sweater and one beautiful long-sleeved T-shirt, both with a little note from me on the back. These are just for the weird nerds who care about beginnings and ends, like me. One day your kid will be like “what’s this T-shirt?” and you can be like “Oh, just a commemorative Melodrama thing” and feel all cool. Because let’s be real, Melodrama’s going to age like the finest of wines. Ok I hate myself.</p><p>Love you.

Title: A little note from me
<p>(11/26/2018)</p><p>Hello my dear email friends,</p><p>As you know, I don’t really have social media anymore, but I wanted to share some pictures and thoughts from the end of tour with you.</p><p>Eyeris counted up 116 performances this tour. That includes shows, festivals, radio thingies, TV performances&hellip; holy shit I have no idea how we did all those bloody performances! And now it’s the end, and I’m caught in an overwhelming mix of relief, gratitude, mourning, elation, and exhaustion. As I sit at home at my kitchen table with the dog under my feet and the doors wide open, I’m thankful to be back where I feel most like myself, but also a little spooked to think it will be a while before we see each again, formally. I had gotten used to meeting you all over the world, all those countries, faces, voices. Every show was different in its beauty, every jet-lagged night as freshly excruciating as the first time&hellip; Tour is no joke, it takes so much from you, but is the absolute brightest time. I’ve never felt richer than in those moments with you, all of us heaving to Green Light, or singing Writer together, or Supercut. The way you took this record and made it yours will be a highlight of my life forever.</p><p>So really, this little note is just to say thankyou. Thankyou for continuing to change my life, year after year; for living inside the work that I make; for always being ready for what’s round the corner.</p><p>I haven’t started properly on the next record yet, and I’m not sure how long it’ll be. But I’ve been teaching myself how to play piano, and here and there little bits come out. I think this next one will probably be born around the piano in my house, me and my friends, keeping it simple. But we’ll see.</p><p>I love you so much. Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou. I’ll try drop in from time to time here with a photo or something, let you know that I’m okay. But know that for now I’m happy here at home, living quietly and simply, eating toast, going for walks, swimming. And you’ll hear all about it soon enough. 🥰</p><p>OH and also, I’m going to try make a couple of t-shirts or sweaters, to celebrate the end. You know how useless I am, but keep your eyes peeled for those.</p><p>Ok. That’s all for now. I really love you.</p><p>E xxxxx</p><p>Some pictures from this tour &hellip;<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="397" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ebe3dcea8d88dadd4c205dbd9daadc60/2e3e43540fdf0a7b-ca/s540x810/091158635335ea178c7a414a94f8437efe070414.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="397"/></figure><p>on the way to stage in Argentina, one of my favourite shows ever<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="489" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/cdf027cb6dd79e45fc0a8449627a373a/2e3e43540fdf0a7b-25/s540x810/73df4271a5d3b4869d0d3faef8f5db3660af77a8.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="489"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="489" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/34fa075326fecb978bb057f85dec7818/2e3e43540fdf0a7b-aa/s540x810/d639d473b1c6c6526cb48c4b4af071325cded9ea.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="489"/></figure><p>gorgeous Chile<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="397" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1d62daea65830c7dcd88dddaf08a2c99/2e3e43540fdf0a7b-75/s540x810/fa7dcb8c96503153ccedc1a6445e471bd588b69a.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="397"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="489" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa2a787b29ab4014c44ad80f75747680/2e3e43540fdf0a7b-ad/s540x810/476ad4230c013015fab648fafbe878ad0a23d047.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="489"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="398" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/9587f621bb6e6408965a9f161cbb7e47/2e3e43540fdf0a7b-88/s540x810/35740ae31a5b3d8908747c04b437d5e5e44c35f3.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="398"/></figure><p>came to Brasil :-)</p><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="400" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/39e9d7e8b16b049bbb51675de7371098/2e3e43540fdf0a7b-08/s540x810/f0dcb9fa150101e86ab2affb524420f18ab8c9e4.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="400"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="400" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/119ba3dd9065cce122d6152ea4f98da9/2e3e43540fdf0a7b-12/s540x810/c39300ca1e3fa7ba854bfb95b45eb21ab1e33679.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="400"/></figure><p>MEXICO.

this is legit the very room where we made most of the album, drank a million smoothies, watched the snow fall through the windows, and shared all my secrets. seemed important to go back to the exact spot and channel the heart flows again. i hope you love these <a href="http://lorde.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=c65c9a1ddd&amp;e=03ec919cec">videos</a> like i loved making them.</p><p>x L</p><p>ps melodrama world tour starts soon</p><p>🌼🌻🌹🌸🌺🌷</p><figure data-orig-width="935" data-orig-height="150" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5781232b3f502e643e7aa5d340b02ec0/cc1ae17697f40ca1-bd/s540x810/4dc7d49d4080f0415e4fe0a45cd1802716432cea.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="935" data-orig-height="150"/></figure><p><b>EUROPE DANCE</b><br/>w/ Khalid</p><p>26-Sept -

Never done a music video like this and I can&rsquo;t wait for you to see it. There&rsquo;s running involved.<br/>So it&rsquo;s been something of a big week.. we&rsquo;re in our third country in 4 days, Leg 1 of the tour went onsale, Leg 2 presale not far behind&hellip; oh, and <a href="http://lorde.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=17fd14c80b6498e9b83a718af&amp;id=1d79869b7a&amp;e=03ec919cec">Melodrama came out</a>.<br/>I want to thank you for the outpouring of love this record has already seen. It&rsquo;s been a surreal, incredible week watching the reviews pour in, reading all of your tweets claiming favourite songs and favourite lines, and just generally being so grateful that the world has been kind to my baby. It&rsquo;s so wild making an album for two years in a totally isolated environment and then just letting it out, but the fact that you GET IT makes it all a little less freaky for me. So thankyou.<br/>The thing I really wanted to do with this album cycle is continue the story of the record long after release week - there&rsquo;s SO much stuff still to come. Gorgeous reinterpretations of the music, crazy visuals, performance art, merch&hellip; I can&rsquo;t wait to share it all with you.<br/>If you got a ticket to Leg 1, YAY.
